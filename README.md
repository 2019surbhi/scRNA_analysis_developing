Branch summaries: 
- **main**: Basic version of the Seurat analysis pipeline. Uses log normalization and CCA batch correction for integration.
- **Surbhi-Dev**: [Insert description]
- **Harmony-dev**: Implementation of Harmony for integration. Uses log normalization.
- **Matt-dev**: Matt's development copy of the pipeline. Uses SCTransform, and utilizes either CCA or RPCA for integration. Also implements doublet analysis. 
- **sctransform**: Stable version of pipeline that implements SCTransform for normalization. Otherwise identical to main.
